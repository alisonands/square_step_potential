- Investigated quantum behavior in a square step potential with varying heights (εs). Utilized finite differences for numerical analysis in three cases: εs < 0, 0 > εs > −U0, and εs > U0. Results show distinct wavefunction shifts based on εs values. Analytical validation aligns with numerical findings. Insights into potential applications in diverse dimensions and quantum systems.
